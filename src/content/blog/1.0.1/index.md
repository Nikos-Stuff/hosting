### Quick patch: minor fixes

- Fixed account-creation failures that affected some users.
- Resolved backend API errors impacting authentication and data sync.

### New: Discord linking

You can now link your account with Discord via Profile → OAuth. Benefits:

- Faster login using Discord OAuth.
- Option to unlink anytime from the same settings page.
- Only minimal profile information is requested.

### Important notice

Password and email changes are disabled for now ( In order to prevent any abuse ). If you need to update credentials or require immediate assistance (account recovery or deletion), contact help@nikostuff.com .

Don't worry. We plan to restore these features ASAP using our custom solutions, since the stock options in the panel were difficult to integrate with our system.
