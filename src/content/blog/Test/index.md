### Hello, dear users!

We’re excited to announce that our free hosting service is now in **public beta**!  

What does this mean? You can start using it **right away**! Simply pick a location, run the install script (egg), and enter your e-mail — don’t worry, we **won’t send spam**.  

### What changed / got improved?

- Fixed bugs with Pelican Panel.
- Improved overall experience.
- Added a bunch of QoL options.

And much more smaller things!

This is just the beginning! As we collect feedback and improve the service, you can expect new features and enhancements. We encourage you to explore, experiment, and share your thoughts with us.  

### Donors notice:

I would like to thank **Synthix** for the first donation (10$) and for joining the "Cheese Eater" tier!

As a reminder every donation helps with development / maintaining this project. So again thank you so much <3 

See you soon!
